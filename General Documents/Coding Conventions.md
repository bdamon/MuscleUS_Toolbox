The code uses semantic versioning with a three-part version number (major.minor.patch), with patches correcting bugs or making aesthetic changes and preserving backward compatibility; minor versions adding minor new features and preserving backward compatibility; and major versions adding major new features with a potential loss of backward compatibility. All scripts and functions were set as v. 1.0.0 at the time of manuscript submission. 

Variable names use snake case (stylized as snake_case).
