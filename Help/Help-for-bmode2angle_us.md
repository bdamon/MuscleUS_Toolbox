## 2. Usage
The function bmode2angle_us is used to estimate muscle fascicle orientations in the MuscleUS_Toolbox. The user provides a B-mode image, the mask defining the region of interest in the image, and a structure containing options for estimating the fascicle orientations. The fascicle orientations are estimated using an algorithm presented by Rana et al., (J Biomech, 42:2068, 2009), in which the images are processed using
* Vesselness filtering:
  * A series of Gaussian blurring steps with increasing std. deviations for the Gaussian function; for each one, the vesselness response of the structures is calculated.
  * Determination of the maximum vesselness response
* Determination of local fasicle orientation
  * An anisotropic wavelet is convolved with the vesselness-filtered image at a user-specified range of orientations. The angle at which the maximum convolution of the wavelet with the image is taken as the fascicle orientation.
  * A mask is formed from the vesselness image and used to eliminate signals from areas of low vesselness response.
  * The median angle, across grid squares of user-defined dimensions, is taken and its vector components are calculated.
The function returns the vesselness images, spatial maps of fascicle orientations, and images for quality assurance/inspection, as described below.

The function returns:
* Spatial maps of fascicle orientations, including
  * An image of fascicle oreintations within the user-defined ROI, at the original image resolution
  * A vesselness-masked masked angle image image at the original resolution
  * An image containing the median angles within the grid squares
* An image with the components of unit vectors indicating the fascicle orientations, within the grid squares.
* Images for QA purposes, including 
  * The convolution images
  * A sample wavelet
Angles are specified as a counterclockwise rotation from the right side of the image = 0‚Å∞.

## 3. Syntax

[angle_image, masked_angle_image, angle_image_grid, vector_image, vesselness_mask, vesselness_max, max_cvn_image, cvn_images, sample_wavelet] = 
 bmode2angle_us(image_gray, mask, b2a_options);

The input arguments are:
 
* <i>image_gray</i>: A grayscale, B-mode image at double-precision

* <i>mask</i>: The output of define_muscleroi_us

* <i>b2a_options</i>: A structure containing the following processing options:
  * Parameters describing the Gaussian convolution:
  
    <i>.stdev_1</i>: The minimum standard deviation of the Gaussian blurring window, in pixels

    <i>.stdev_2</i>: The maximum standard deviation of the Gaussian blurring window, in pixels
    
    <i>.stdev_inc</i>: The amount to increase the Gaussian blurring window per iteration, in pixels
   
    <i>.gauss_size</i>: The row x column dimensions of the Gaussian blurring window, in pixels
    
  * Parameters describing the vesselness response calculation:
  
    <i>.vessel_beta</i>: The beta value in the vesselness response function
   
    <i>.vessel_c</i>: The C value in the vesselness response function
    
  * Parameters describing the formation of the wavelet and wavelet convolution with the vesselness-filtered image:
  
    <i>.wavelet_damp</i>: The damping coefficient D of the wavelet
   
    <i>.wavelet_kernel</i>: The kernel size of the wavelet, in pixels
   
    <i>.wavelet_freq</i>: he expected spatial frequency of the fascicles, pixels<sup>-1</sup>
  
    <i>.wavelet_freq</i>: The row x column dimensions of the Gaussian blurring window, in pixels
    
    <i>.min_angle</i>: The minimum angle to use when convolving the wavelets with the image, in degrees (note that the right side of the image = 0 degrees and angles increase in a CCW manner).
  
    <i>.max_angle</i>: The maximum angle to use when convolving the wavelets with the image, in degrees
  
    <i>.num_angles</i>: The number of angles to use when convolving the wavelets with the image
    
  * Parameters describing the averaging over grid squares:
  
    <i>.num_pixels</i>: A P x 2 matrix defining the grid square sizes to be analyzed. Each row of num_pixels defines the row and column sizes of the grid squares, in pixels (i.e., n x m). The averaging is repeated for each row, p, of num_pixels.

    
  * Parameters describing the formation of the vesselness mask using either Otsu's method of k-means clustering:
  
    <i>.max_angle</i>: The multiplier for Otsu's threshold in the vesselness-masked images, when Otsu's method is used to filter the image. For example, setting b2a_options.otsu to 1 uses the threshold set by Otsu's method.  Setting b2a_options.otsu to 0.5 uses 1/2 of this threshold.
  
    <i>.k</i>: A two-element vector with the number of clusters and the ordinal rank, of the cluster to be used, when k-means clustering is used to filter the image

The output arguments are:

* <i>angle_image</i>: An image with per-pixel fasicle orientations

* <i>masked_angle_image</i>: <i>angle_image</i> with the muscle ROI mask applied

* <i>angle_image_grid</i>: The gridded angle image, at the user-defined resolution

* <i>vector_image</i>: The X and Y components of the angles in the gridded image

* vesselness_mask: The mask calculated fromteh vesselness image

* vesselness_max: The maximum vesselness response image

* max_cvn_image: An image showing trhe maximum value of the convolution of wavelet with the pixels

* cvn_images: All of the convolution images

* sample_wavelet: The wavelet use to determine fascicle orientation

## 4. Example Code
Given:
1.	A grayscale image stored in the variable image_data_struc.gray;

the following code will allow the user to 

1.	Define a Gaussian kernel with standard deviations of 1.5-3 pixels and kernel size 30x30, in SD increments of 0.5 pixels
2.	Estimate the vesselness response with coefficients Beta = 0.75 and C=0.25
3.	Create an anisotropic wavelet with damping coefficient = 2.5, wavelet frequency = 6, kernel size of 26x26, across angles of 155 to 200 degrees, in steps of 1 degree
4.	Form a vesselness mask using the threshold set by Otsu's method
